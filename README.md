# MALICIOUS DOMAIN DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

**♦ Growing online presence of harmful websites poses significant threats, highlighting the importance
of early detection to mitigate risks.**

**♦ This project identifies malicious domains using connection behavior analysis and machine learning.**

**♦ Leveraging domain features, we build a classifier model adept at distinguishing between benign and harmful domains, with DNS playing a crucial role in implementation**

**♦ Data Collection: Acquire domain-specific data from diverse sources, utilizing web scraping tools or accessing datasets from publicly available repositories.**

**♦ Data Preprocessing: Prepare collected data for analysis by cleaning it, handling duplicates, missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Extract pertinent features such as domain length, presence of hyphens or numbers, frequency of specific characters, and whois features.**

**♦ Model Training: Train machine learning models using pre-processed data. Explore various algorithms like Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting to optimize model performance.**

**♦ Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning if required.**

**♦ Deployment: Deploy the trained model into a practical application for real-time detection of malicious domains.**
