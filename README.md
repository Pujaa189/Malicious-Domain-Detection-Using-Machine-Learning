Malicious Domain Detection using Machine Learning

**♦ Growing online presence of harmful websites poses significant threats, highlighting the importance
of early detection to mitigate risks.**

**♦ This project identifies malicious domains using connection behavior analysis and machine learning.**

**♦ Leveraging domain features, we build a classifier model adept at distinguishing between benign and harmful domains, with DNS playing a crucial role in implementation**
